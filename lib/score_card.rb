class ScoreCard
  # Calculate the full score from a bowling score-card.
  #
  # Args:
  #   score_card: String
  #     A space-separated string of 10 frames.
  #
  # Returns: Integer
  #   Representing the score of the game.
  #
  # Possible frame scores:
  #   "X": strike (10 + following 2 rolls, unless 10th frame then 10)
  #   "i/": spare (10 + following roll, unless 10th frame then 10)
  #   "ij": open frame (i+j)
  #   "-": gutter ball(s) (0)
  #
  #   * where i,j are between 1 and 9 and i+j < 10
  #
  # Example input:
  #   "X X X X X X X X X XXX" - the perfect game, scores 300.
  #   "X 7/ 9- X -8 8/ - 72 X X81" has a score of 140.
  #
  # Note:
  #   You may assume all score-cards are valid.
  #   A single frame scoring "-" means two gutter balls were rolled.
  #   A strike or spare in the 10th frame unlocks a bonus roll, but scores 10 only.
